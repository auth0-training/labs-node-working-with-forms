Because of this, the user was asked to provide their job title information. Since only one rule is triggered during a particular post-login event, this was the only Form step the user experienced. This is to limit how much information we ask from a user at any given time, to reduce friction and to ensure the user does not abandon the onboarding process.\n\nSo what happens when the user logs in again? Let's check it out!\n\n1. If you are no longer on the Authentication Profile page, you can get there from the [Auth0 Management Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/) and going to **Authentication > Authentication Profile**.\n1. Select the **Try** button again to open the Universal Login page.\n1. Log in as the user you registered in the previous step.\n> Notice that this time the second rule, **Missing Company Data**, is triggered. Now the Form step that prompts the user for their Company name and Company size is rendered.\n1. Supply values for these two fields and select **Continue**.\n1. Select **Continue**.\n> You should now see an *It Works!* message, indicating that the user would now be authenticated to the application.\n1. You can close this tab by clicking **Take me to the dashboard**.\n\n### ❓️ Thought question: Which rule would be triggered on the user's next login? What would be the result? \n\nThink about the rules that were defined for this form:\n1. **Missing Profile Data**: Triggered when the user's job_title is missing from the user_metadata.\n2. **Missing Company Information**: Triggered when the user's company_name and company_size is missing from the user_metadata.\n3. **Default**: Triggered in all other cases.\n\n"
